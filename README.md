# HIAC_Parser
The production version of the HIAC Parser for BioDPD

08/05/25 - The version brought on from development takes the sum of all the cummulative counts for the categories specified. For particles larger than 2 it uses 2 + 5. For particles larger than 10 it uses 10 + 15. And for 25 it is 25. The DAA template reports all the raw values (1.5, 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, etc.). This should change in fure versions, waiting input from Hendrik.
